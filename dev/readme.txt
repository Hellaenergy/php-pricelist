Hi There!

Thanks for downloading this code!

I have some notes for you:

1. You have to create your database using PhpMyAdmin
2. Database name is "1phpbeginnercrudlevel2"
3. Import the SQL file called "1phpbeginnercrudlevel2.sql" located in the "dev" folder.
4. You can ask me any PHP questions related to this code. Go to https://fb.com/codeofninja
